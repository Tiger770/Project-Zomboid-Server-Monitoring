# Project-Zomboid-Server-Monitoring
A collection of PowerShell scripts designed to pull legible information from a dedicated Project Zombid server log files.

This project is still in development, and will evolve greatly over time.  Eventually I'd like to be able to incorporate the data I collect and gather with these utilites to build a web landing page for my faction to reference.
